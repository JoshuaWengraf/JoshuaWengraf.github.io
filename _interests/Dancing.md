I started my dancing journey in the Manchester University Latin and Ballroom Dance Society. Here I studied mostly Waltz, Quickstep, Cha Cha and Jive for several years. After graduating I also joined the social dance scene in Manchester city centre, adding Salsa, Bachata and Brazilian Zouk to the mix.
