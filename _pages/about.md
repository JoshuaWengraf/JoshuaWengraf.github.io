I am a Master of Physics (MPhys) graduate from the University of Manchester. In September 2017 I joined the Graphene NOWNANO CDT programme, where I measured electron transport at The University of Manchester. My research focussed on a spectroscopic method for studying the electron-phonon interaction in graphene. I graduated from the programme in January 2020 with an MSc (by research) (awarded by Lancaster University), and I am now travelling around the world in search of new projects.
