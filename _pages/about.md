I am a Master of Physics (MPhys) graduate from the University of Manchester. In September 2017 I joined the Graphene NOWNANO CDT programme, where I measured electron transport in graphene at The University of Manchester. My research focussed spectroscopic measurements of the electron-phonon interaction in graphene  using a phenomenon called the magnetophonon effect. In January 2020 I graduated the programme with an MSc (by research) (awarded by Lancaster University), and I am now travelling around the world in search of new projects.
