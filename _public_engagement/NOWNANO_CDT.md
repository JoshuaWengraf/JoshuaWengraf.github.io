In 2014 a friend and I founded a volunteering society at the University of Manchester called STEMsoc. The idea was to encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects and to help address the gender imbalance in these subjects. I have demonstrated table-top science at the
<a href="http://www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/highlights/manchester_science_festival/science_spectacular/">Science Spectacular</a> fair.  I also presented our projects at a <a href="http://www.graphene-nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-and-events/cdt-cohort-completes-public-engagement-training.htm">CDT public engagement training session</a>.

You can find out about STEMsoc's recent activities on facebook or www.stemsoc.org.uk.

The NOWNANO CDT Outreach team is a volunteering arm of the NOWNANO CDT programme. In 2018 I showcased graphene research at Science Spectacular and Bluedot Festival.
