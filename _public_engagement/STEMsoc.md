STEMsoc is a volunteering society at the University of Manchester founded by myself and a friend in September 2014. The aim of the society is to encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue the STEM subjects and to address the gender imbalance in these subjects (STEM being an abbreviation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). You can find out about our recent activities at www.stemsoc.org.uk and facebook, see also CDT public engagement training.
