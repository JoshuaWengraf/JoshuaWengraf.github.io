In 2014 a friend and I founded a volunteering society at the University of Manchester called STEMsoc. The idea was to encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects and to help address the gender imbalance in these subjects. I have demonstrated at 
<a href="http://www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/highlights/manchester_science_festival/science_spectacular/">Science Spectacular</a>
and the Manchester British Science Week fair. I also presented our projects in 2019 for a <a href="http://www.graphene-nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-and-events/cdt-cohort-completes-public-engagement-training.htm">CDT public engagement training session</a> 
You can find out about our recent activities on facebook or www.stemsoc.org.uk.
