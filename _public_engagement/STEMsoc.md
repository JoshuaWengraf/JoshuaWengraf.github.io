excerpt: "In 2014 a friend and I founded STEMsoc, a volunteering society at the University of Manchester. The idea is to encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects and to help address the gender imbalance in these subjects. I demonstrated table-top science at the [Science Spectacular](www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/highlights/manchester_science_festival/science_spectacular/) fair, and I also presented our projects at a [CDT public engagement training session](http://www.graphene-nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-and-events/cdt-cohort-completes-public-engagement-training.htm)

In 2014 a friend and I founded a volunteering society at the University of Manchester called STEMsoc. The idea was to encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects and to help address the gender imbalance in these subjects. I have demonstrated table-top science at the [Science Spectacular](www.engagement.manchester.ac.uk/highlights/manchester_science_festival/science_spectacular/) fair.  I also presented our projects at a [CDT public engagement training session](http://www.graphene-nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-and-events/cdt-cohort-completes-public-engagement-training.htm)
