For my final year masters project, in collaboration with Daniel Pettitt and supervised by Dr. Ingo Dierking, I developed a simulation to model the spread of ash dieback in the UK. This was fit to data [1] provided by the forestry commission. The simulation was executed on a square grid, with infected squares infecting neighboring squares with probability p and killing them with probability 1-p; these represent infection and immunisation respectfully. We also introduced a probability for an infected square to infect any other random square on the grid. We fit values of p to the model to determine whether the epidemic was dominated by short range or long-range infections
