For my final year masters project, in collaboration with Daniel Pettitt and supervised by Dr. Ingo Dierking, I developed a simulation to model the spread of ash dieback in the UK. The simulation was executed on a square grid, with infected squares infecting neighboring squares with probability p and killing them with probability 1-p; these represent infection and immunisation respectfully. We also introduced a probability for infected squares to infect any other random square on the grid. We fit values of p to data provided by the forrestry commission. This gives insight as to whether the epidemic was dominated by short range or long-range infections.
