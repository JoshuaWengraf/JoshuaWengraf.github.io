For my summer reserach project I performed simulations to model laser heated, non-local, one dimensional electron transport in the presence of an applied magnetic field. This essentially involved experimenting with different plasma parameters to enhance the confinement. Plasma paremeters were input via a shell script and the simulations were run in Fortran 77. This work was supervised by Dr Christopher Ridgers.
